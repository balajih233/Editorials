        <p>Now the string length is 2 and both elements are not equal. I can select any index and remove it. I remove element at index 0. After removing my string length will be 1 and I cannot perform any operations.</p><br>
        <br>

        <p>In this problem we need to check only two cases. First case is what if the string do not have either '1' or '0'. If my string is "00000" then I cannot select any index and perform this operation because there are no not equal adjacent elements.</p><br>
        <p>Second case is what if my string contains 1 different character like "10000". If the string is like this I will select this element index and perform operation.</p><br>
        <p>I simply count '0' and '1' in string. If either of zeroes or ones count is zero then I will print length of string otherwise I will print 1.</p><br>

        <h1>Lottery Tickets</h1>
        <p>This problem says that there are N lottery tickets with number A[i] on it. All numbers are distinct. Chef bought a lottery ticket with a number A[i] on it and chef will win if the person is closest to a number 'X'. We need to find how many numbers 'X' will satisfy so that chef will win. Let me explain with an example.</p> <br>
        <p>Let us consider there are 3 lottery tickets with numbers [5, 1, 12] on it. Chef will take a ticket with number 5 on it because the first ticket number is 5.</p> <br>
        <p>I will take a variable 'count' to count possible values of X. count=0</p><br>
        <p>Let us start by taking X as 1. When X is 1 then chef wont win because there is a person with ticket having number 1 on it. My count remains same.</p><br>
        <p>count = 0</p><br>
        <p>Now we take X = 2. When X is 2 then the closest number is 1 because absolute differnce between 2 and 1 is 1 and absolute differnce between chef's number 5 and 1 is 4. So chef won't win. Here I avoid 12 because we know that 12 is not even close to 1.</p><br>
        <p>count = 0</p><br>
        <p>Now we take X = 3. When X is 3 then the absolute difference between 3 and 1 is 2 and also absolute differnce between chef's number 5 and 3 is 2 which is equal to person with lottery number 1. So we can consider 3 as winning case. I will increase my count.</p><br>
        <p>count = count + 1 => count = 1.</p><br>
        <p>Now we take X = 4. When X is 4 then the absolute difference between 4 and 1 is 3 and also absolute differnce between chef's number 5 and 4 is 1 which indicates that chef's ticket is closer to X. So we can consider 4 as winning case. I will increase my count.</p>
        <p>count = count + 1 => count = 2.</p><br>
        <p>If X = 5 then we can say that chef is the winner. So, I will increment my count.</p><br>
        <p>count = count + 1 => count = 3.</p><br>
        <p>Now we take X = 6. When X is 6 then the absolute difference between 6 and 1 is 5 and also absolute differnce between chef's number 5 and 6 is 1 which indicates that chef's ticket is closer to X. So we can consider 5 as winning case. I will increase my count.</p>
        <p>count = count + 1 => count = 4.</p><br>
        <p>Now we take X = 7. When X is 7 then the absolute difference between 7 and 1 is 6 and also absolute differnce between chef's number 5 and 6 is 1 which indicates that chef's ticket is closer to X. So we can consider 6 as winning case. I will increase my count.</p>
        <p>count = count + 1 => count = 5.</p><br>
        <p>Now we take X = 8. As I am approaching nearer to 12 I will consider 12 and avoid 1 because 1 is no closer to X. When X is 8 then the absolute difference between 8 and 12 is 4 and also absolute differnce between chef's number 5 and 8 is 3 which indicates that chef's ticket is closer to X. So we can consider 7 as winning case. I will increase my count.</p>
        <p>count = count + 1 => count = 6.</p><br>
        <p>Now we take X = 9. When X is 9 then absolute difference between 9 and 12 is 3 and also absolute difference between chef's number 5 and 9 is 4 which indicates 12 is closer to X. As we increment X, We go far from chef's number. So we end here and my answer will be 6.</p><br>
        <p>A[i] will ranges from 1 to 1000000. First I take X as chef's number and I will sort the array. I sorted array because I need to know how many numbers are there before and after chef's number. I will search for chef's number and take the index of it.</p> <br>
        <p>If the chef's number is minimum that means it is the first element after sorting then I can say that numbers before A[0] are closer to chef's number. I need to find numbers which are closer in between A[0] and A[1]. To know numbers which are closer to A[0], I will find how many numbers are there between A[0] and A[1] which is A[1]-A[0]. Now I will divide the difference with 2 then I will get closer numbers. So my answer is</p><br>
        <p>answer = A[0] + (( A[1] - A[0] ) / 2)</p><br>
        <p>If the chef's number is maximum that means it is the last element after sorting then I can say that numbers after A[n-1] are closer to chef's number. Maximum possible ticket number is 1000000. So there will be 1000000-A[n-1] numbers. Also we need to how many numbers between previous element of chef's number are closer to chef's number. To know numbers which are closer to A[n-1], I will find how many numbers are there between A[n-1] and A[n-2] which is A[n-1] - A[n-2]. Now I will divide the difference with 2 then I will get closer numbers. So my answer is A[0]+((A[n - 1] - A[n - 2]) / 2). So my answer is</p><br>
        <p>answer = 1000000 - A[n-1] + 1 + (A[n - 1] - A[n - 2])/2.</p><br>
        <p>If the chef's number is found between index 1 and index n-2 then I need find numbers which are closer to preeceding element and numbers which are closer to succeeding element. So my answer is</p><br>
        answer = ((A[ind] - A[ind-1])/2) + ((A[ind+1] - A[ind])/2) + 1;
